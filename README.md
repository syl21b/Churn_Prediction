Please re-run the code on Jupyter Notebook if you encounter issues with loading the data. 
The problem may arise from the connection between Kaggle and Python when attempting 
to fetch data through a link from online sources.

The entire program will take at least 30 minutes to complete one run because the dataset is large.
